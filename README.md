# Project
Save time 2 to 4 day iterations <br>
low coupling, high cohesion <br>
Agile + Fast Feedback + transparent <br>
1Team <br>

## 1) 6 Day Discovery
+ Learn from users
+ Technical Landscape
+ Mobilise ( Contract Start ) <br>
User-centered design and minimise technical risk. <br>
Exploring the problem space <br>
What should we do first prioritise <br>
set an agreed intention (business case) <br>
Challege <-- uncertainty <br>
Clear Outcome <-- A data interface to make decisions and to see if those decision are working in real time. <br>
Assumptions <-- There is internal data and public external data availible. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This project doesn't exsist yet/ previous work. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a set way to make this system. <br>
understand the user functionaility needed. <br>
what are the moving parts components <br>
how to define measure value <br>
security + it teams engagement <br>
**Alpha Assessment** 36points?



## 2) 12 Day Alpha (prototype)
+ Refine journeys with users
+ Prototype Design Choices ( Interim Findings )
+ Embed Cabinet Staff (continues through stages 3 + 4) to ensure ongoing knowledge transfer.
+ Beta Road Map ( Alpha Assess )
+ **showcase** <br>
Mvp <br>
testing hypotheses <br>
can we solve the problem <br>
is it useful ? <br>

data investigation <br>
technology + cloud platform plan <br>
testing? <br>

learning <-- sketching + testing <-- refining + planning.

**Beta Assessment** ?



## 3) 36.5 Day Beta
+ Ongoing user research and feedback
+ Incremental delivery of prioritised user stories ( Beta Backlog )
+ Embed Cabinet Staff ( private Beta Assess )
+ Private Beta
+ Public Beta Assess
+ Public Beta
ongoing incremental delivery
is it usable <br>
Accessibility <br>
Service standard <br>
CI/ CD <br>

## 4) Support
+ Incremental delivery of prioritised user stories.
ongoing incremental delivery
is it scalable (can the whole population use it)<br>


quick wins <-- small bets not big ones, fast feedback, exsisting componnets we can use <br>

information and users at every level <br>
