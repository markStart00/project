## Desing (continouse design and research)
1. "Service design starts with identifying user needs ... If you don't know what the user needs are, you won't build the right thing." - [Government Design Principle 1](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles) 
2. An Api(s) that can be shared, and link to the work of others. - [Government Design Principle 2](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
3. Designing for everyone - [Government Design Principle 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
4. Design a digital service that helps people to do something not a website. - [Government Design Principle 8](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
5. The same language, the same design patterns for farmiliatiry, share and reuse. - [Government Design Principle 9](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
6. "We should share what we're doing whenever we can ... share code, share designs, share ideas ... The more eyes on the service the better it gets" - [Government Design Principle 10](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
